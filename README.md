# HeapSort

## HeapSort implemented in Python 3.
The code is simple, as it is.

## Complexity Analysis for Heap Construction
Many people get confused at the time complexity of the heap construction algorithm. The analysis requires only middle or high school math.

There is a nice lecture note at https://www.cs.umd.edu/~meesh/351/mount/lectures/lect14-heapsort-analysis-part.pdf, where the analysis part says "This is a sum that we have never seen before," which surprised me when I first read it (I thought I was wrong). The calculus way is great. It's a pleasure to see elementary math works there, too.
